# Nutroascan — Your Calm Food Companion

Nutrascan is a voice-first, nutrition-aware system designed for real families. It helps young people eat better and quietly take care of their parents — without pressure, guilt, or complex tracking.

This isn’t another health dashboard. It’s a calm buddy that fits into how we actually live, eat, and talk.

## 👥 Who It’s For

- Youth (18–30): who want to eat better themselves — and support their elders
- Elders (45+): who don’t use apps but can talk to a voice assistant
- Families: who want a soft check-in loop around food, not a full-blown medical tracker

## 🎯 What It Solves

Most apps either:
- Focus too much on fitness or diet plans
- Expect everyone to tap, swipe, scan
- Ignore Indian meals or daily chaos

Nutroscan flips that.
- You log meals by voice or tap
- Your parent just talks to it
- You both get soft nudges and weekly insights — no stress

## 💡 Core Features

- Voice-first meal logging (Hindi, Marathi, English)
- Calm voice replies (“Dal rice — balanced meal.”)
- Dual dashboard (youth logs + elder summary)
- Privacy control: elders choose what’s shared
- Weekly food recaps, not calorie breakdowns

## 🧠 Tech Stack (For Developers)

- React / Next.js Frontend
- Node.js + Express backend (for voice & logging APIs)
- MongoDB / Firebase for user data
- Google Cloud / Whisper for voice handling
- Figma, XD for design flows

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
/components   → Reusable UI parts
/pages        → App routes & main screens

```

## ✏️ Usage Examples

- User logs: “Had poha and chai.” → App: “Logged. Light and filling.”
- Parent says: “Had roti sabzi.” → App: “Got it. Hope it was warm.”
- Youth sees: “Mom logged lunch. Skipped dinner yesterday.”

## 🚧 Roadmap
